# WaterSimulation
This is the course project for CS535 Computer Graphics in Purdue University. Used OpenGL to implement a water simulation program that contained reflection, refraction, and caustic effect of water. Method to construct a realtime interactive water surface is representing the surface using heightmap.
# Control
W-Camera Forward <br />
S-Camera Outward <br />
A-Camera Left <br />
D-Camera Right <br />
Q-Camera Up <br />
E-Camera Down <br />
Left mouse (Water surface)-Create water ripple on surface <br />
Left mouse (ImGui Window)-Modify properties on ripple, color, etc <br />
# Result
![Caustic Effect under water](/caustic.gif) <br />
![Reflection and refraction on the water surface](/surface.gif)
