# WaterSimulation
This is the course project for CS535 Computer Graphics in Purdue University. Used OpenGL to implement a water simulation program that contained reflection, refraction, and caustic effect of water. Method to construct a realtime interactive water surface is representing the surface using heightmap.
# Control
W-Camera Forward
S-Camera Outward
A-Camera Left
D-Camera Right
Q-Camera Up
E-Camera Down
Left mouse (Water surface)-Create water ripple on surface
Left mouse (ImGui Window)-Modify properties on ripple, color, etc
# Result
![Caustic Effect under water](/caustic.gif)
![Reflection and refraction on the water surface](/surface.gif)
